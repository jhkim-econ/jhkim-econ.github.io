## A. Introduction  

### (1) Overview of Build-Transfer-Lease (BTL) Projects
> Contact: **Junghwan Kim**, Senior Budget Analyst (na32@assembly.go.kr)

**Private Investment Projects (PPP)** are initiatives promoted under the *Act on Public-Private Partnerships in Infrastructure*, aimed at encouraging private-sector involvement in traditionally public-funded sectors such as roads, ports, railways, schools, and environmental facilities. These projects aim to enhance infrastructure expansion and operation through creative and efficient private sector participation.

PPP projects are broadly categorized into:

1. **Revenue-based Models**:  
   - Types: BTO (Build-Transfer-Operate), BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer), BOO (Build-Own-Operate).
   - After construction, private operators are granted operation rights and recover investments through **user fees** collected from end-users.

2. **Lease-type Models (BTL)**:  
   - Similar to revenue-based models in granting temporary operational rights.
   - However, instead of charging user fees, the **government leases the facility** and pays rent over time.  
   - Rent payments are used to recover the private investment and cover operating expenses.

#### Comparison: Revenue-Based vs Lease-Based PPP Models

| **Category**                              | **Revenue-Based PPP**                                           | **Lease-Based PPP (BTL)**                                    |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Facility Type & Nature**               | Facilities that can recover investment via user fees             | Facilities where user fees are insufficient for recovery       |
| **Typical Projects**                     | Expressways, ports, light rail, subways, sewage plants, etc.     | Schools, military housing, welfare centers, conventional rail |
| **Investment Recovery**                  | Through **user fees paid by end-users**                          | Through **rental payments by the government**                 |
| **Risk Bearing**                         | Private sector bears **demand risk**                             | **Demand risk excluded** for private sector                   |
| **Fee Structure**                        | Based on total project cost + price index adjustment             | Based on total private investment, paid in **equal rents**     |
| **Fiscal Support for Construction**      | Includes construction subsidies and land compensation            | **No fiscal support in principle**                            |

### (2) 2025 Ceiling Allocation for BTL Projects

Article 4 of the *Act on Public-Private Partnerships in Infrastructure* enumerates **revenue-based** and **lease-based (BTL)** private investment models as official PPP methods. Article 2, Clause 2 of the same Act formally recognizes BTL as a legal PPP type.

Furthermore, Article 7-2 stipulates that, **for BTL projects**, the total ceiling, ceilings by facility, and contingency ceilings must be **submitted to the National Assembly at least 120 days before the start of the fiscal year**, and the Assembly must **approve the allocation at least 30 days prior** to the fiscal year's start.

The government‚Äôs **2025 BTL ceiling proposal** submitted to the Assembly includes **KRW 1.6431 trillion across 11 projects**.

### Long-Term Government Payment Projection (2024‚Äì2033)

According to Article 9-2 of the *National Finance Act*, the Minister of Economy and Finance must submit a **government payment projection** (under Article 24-2 of the PPP Act) at least **120 days prior to each fiscal year**.

The projection must cover a **10-year period**, specifying expected **rental payments and operating costs** by **project type and line ministry**.

According to the *2024‚Äì2033 BTL Government Payment Projection*, the total projected nominal payments over 10 years amount to **KRW 18.8583 trillion**, composed of:

- **Rental Payments (National Projects)**: KRW 12.1647 trillion  
- **Rental Payments (Subsidized Local Projects)**: KRW 3.8397 trillion  
- **Operating Expenses (National Projects)**: KRW 2.8539 trillion

## B. Legislative Review  
### (1) Issues Concerning the Ceiling Allocation for BTL Projects

The ceiling allocation for BTL projects submitted by the government **only includes the total facility construction costs**, excluding the **operating costs** to be paid to the project operator over the operational period.

However, since operating costs are later bundled into **government payments (rental + O&M)**, they represent a **de facto fiscal obligation**. Thus, they should also be subject to **parliamentary deliberation**.

### Legal Ambiguity in the Definition of "Total Ceiling"

- Article 7-2 of the *Act on Public-Private Partnerships in Infrastructure* mandates that the **total ceiling**, **facility-specific ceilings**, and **contingency ceilings** for BTL projects be submitted to the National Assembly 120 days before the start of the fiscal year and approved 30 days before the start.
- **However, the term ‚Äútotal ceiling‚Äù itself is not legally defined.**
- The *Enforcement Decree* only prescribes procedural submission requirements (including previous year's contingency usage), but does **not define the components or calculation method** of the total ceiling.

### Current MOEF Interpretation and Practical Gap

The **2024 Basic Plan for Private Investment Projects** (Part II, General Guidelines) defines the ceiling as the ‚Äúestimated total project cost‚Äù under Article 2-2 of the Enforcement Decree, which includes:

- Feasibility study costs,
- Design and engineering fees,
- Construction,
- Land compensation,
- Incidental expenses.

**O&M (Operating and Maintenance) expenses are not included.**

However, in reality, government payments for BTL projects include:

1. **Rental payments** (covering capital investment), and  
2. **Operating costs** (recurring quarterly payments during the operation period).

### Example: Seogye-dong Cultural Facility BTL Project

In 2021, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST) proposed a ceiling of KRW 104.0 billion for the Seogye-dong cultural complex. In the 2023 ceiling amendment, the total ceiling was adjusted to KRW 124.4 billion through contingency usage reporting.

However, the final implementation agreement revealed:

- The **facility construction cost** was KRW 122.9 billion (within ceiling),
- **Operating cost** of KRW 92.3 billion **was not reflected in the ceiling**,
- **Supervision cost** of KRW 4.4 billion also added later.

#### Breakdown of Final Project Costs (Unit: KRW million)

| Category               | Ceiling (Notified) | Proposal (Final) |
|------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Facility Construction  | 124,407            | 122,947          |
| Operating Cost (O&M)   | *100,456*          | *92,258*         |
| Supervision Cost       | *4,386*            | *4,386*          |

> *Shaded rows indicate costs not reflected in the original ceiling but ultimately included in government payments.*

> **Source**: Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism  
> *Status of the Seogye-dong Cultural Facility BTL Project as of July 2024*

---

### Policy Implication

Despite being excluded from the ceiling proposal, **operating costs are eventually paid as part of government obligations**, without prior review by the National Assembly.

By contrast, the **Total Project Cost Management System** for informatization projects includes O&M for five years post-construction, along with future expansion costs.

Thus, **excluding O&M from the BTL ceiling** constitutes a **serious procedural flaw** that undermines legislative oversight.

While the Ministry of Economy and Finance argues that operating costs are not fixed debts but arise annually, the implementation agreements **clearly predetermine total O&M amounts and schedules**, implying their **contractual nature as binding obligations**.

---

## (2) Issues in Feasibility and Value-for-Money (VfM) Analysis of BTL Projects

### (a) Overview of VfM Analysis in Lease-Type PPP Projects

Under the *Act on Public-Private Partnerships in Infrastructure*, competent authorities must designate infrastructure projects as eligible for private investment. Projects exceeding a certain scale require a feasibility analysis and review by a steering committee.

The Enforcement Decree mandates that for **privately proposed projects exceeding KRW 200 billion**, a **Value-for-Money (VfM) analysis** be conducted. This includes evaluating demand projections and comparing costs against public implementation alternatives.

According to the *2024 Basic Plan for PPP Projects*, government-notified projects undergo feasibility analysis, while large private proposals require VfM studies. In practice, even small-scale projects are often assessed using similar standards.

A VfM analysis compares:

- **PSC (Public Sector Comparator)**: Traditional public implementation.
- **PFI (Private Finance Initiative)**: Lease-type (BTL) model.

The comparison involves calculating the present value of the **total life-cycle costs** for both alternatives. The PFI is deemed ‚Äúvalue for money‚Äù if its **present value of government payments** is **less than** that of the PSC.

---

### (b) Legislative Review

#### 1. On Discount Rate Assumptions

In the 2025 BTL ceiling proposal, discount rates applied (5.03% to 5.39%) are relatively high, potentially favoring PFI models.

**Discount Rates in VfM Analyses (Unit: %)**

| Facility                                 | Discount Rate |
|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Gyeryong Officer Housing (MoD)           | 5.03%          |
| Jangseong Education Facility Phase 2     | 5.03%          |
| Jeungpyeong Military Facility            | 5.39%          |
| Daegu Sewer Facility (MoE)               | 5.24%          |

> Source: Korea Development Institute (KDI)

**Government Bond Yields (2024.10.17)**

| Maturity | Yield (%) |
|----------|-----------|
| 5 years  | 2.924     |
| 10 years | 3.008     |
| 20 years | 2.903     |

MOEF argues that BTL discount rates reflect risk and cannot be directly compared to risk-free government bond rates.

However:
- KDI guidelines recommend **risk-free discounting** for fixed-payment contracts.
- MOEF guidelines specify a **real discount rate of 2.5%**, adjusted for inflation.
- Post-COVID inflation assumptions may distort present-value estimates.

---

#### 2. Gap Between Project Return and Discount Rate

In some cases, the private IRR is **lower** than the discount rate, which **favors PFI outcomes** in the analysis.

**Example: Daegu Sewer BTL (MoE)**

| Metric                    | Proposal | VfM Analysis |
|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| IRR (Private Operator)    | 4.27%    | 3.29%        |
| Discount Rate (PFI)       | 4.50%    | 5.24%        |

> Result: Discount rate raised while IRR reduced, increasing perceived VfM for PFI.

---

#### 3. Inconsistencies in Bid/Cost Application Rates

A key driver of VfM results is the difference in **bid rates** (PSC) and **application rates** (PFI), which determine construction costs.

**Example: Daegu Sewer Pipeline Project**

| Cost Item | Reference (KRW M) | PSC Rate | PSC Value | PFI Rate | PFI Value |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Survey    | 5,833             | 93.57%   | 5,458     | 61.7%    | 2,998     |
| Design    | 15,637            | 94.64%   | 14,799    | 69.9%    | 12,788    |
| Work      | 571,893           | 93.57%   | 535,120   | 83.6%    | 489,000   |

> PSC uses standard bid ratios from 2018 KDI guidelines.  
> PFI uses flexible, loosely defined application rates based on past contracts.

This practice raises concerns about consistency and objectivity. Assuming cost savings from private-led execution also casts doubt on public sector procurement capability.

MOEF acknowledged plans to update bid data using post-2016 infrastructure procurement results.

---

## Conclusion

The VfM analysis framework for BTL projects requires better consistency in:

- Discount rate assumptions
- Return-on-investment benchmarks
- Cost application methods

Without this, VfM results may be biased in favor of PFI models, weakening the credibility of project evaluations and fiscal transparency.

---

### (c) Utilization of Analysis Results

#### 1. Inclusion of Ineligible Projects in Ceiling Proposal

Some projects listed in the **2025 BTL ceiling proposal** were found to be **ineligible based on VfM analysis** conducted by the Korea Development Institute (KDI). Despite this, they were still included in the proposal.

**Defense Ministry Projects Included in the Ceiling**

| Facility                  | Ceiling (KRW 100M) |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Jeungpyeong Barracks      | 431                |
| Gyeryong Officer Housing  | 938                |
| Jangseong Education (P2)  | 903                |
| **Total**                 | **2,272**          |

> *Source: 2025 BTL Ceiling Proposal*

According to KDI‚Äôs VfM report:

- **Gyeryong Officer Housing**:  
  PSC NPV = 98.58B vs. PFI NPV = 99.44B ‚Üí **Not VfM**
  
- **Jangseong Education Facility (Phase 2)**:  
  PSC NPV = 94.79B vs. PFI NPV = 95.59B ‚Üí **Not VfM**
  
- **Jeungpyeong Barracks**:  
  PSC NPV = 40.85B vs. PFI NPV = 39.54B ‚Üí **VfM Achieved**, but due to higher discount rate (5.39%)

**VfM Comparison by Facility** (Unit: KRW million)

| Facility                  | PSC NPV | PFI NPV | Discount Rate (%) |
|---------------------------|---------|---------|--------------------|
| Gyeryong Officer Housing  | 98,580  | 99,440  | 5.03               |
| Jangseong Education (P2)  | 94,794  | 95,596  | 5.03               |
| Jeungpyeong Barracks      | 40,847  | 39,539  | 5.39               |

> *Source: Korea Development Institute (KDI)*

MOEF claims these were included based on **sensitivity scenarios** assuming a 2% cut in construction or 14% cut in O&M costs. However, there is **no evidence of such cost reductions** being realistically achievable or of equivalent PSC revisions being considered.

---

#### 2. Overstatement of Ceiling Based on PSC Instead of PFI Estimates

In several cases, including the **Daegu sewer pipeline project**, the ceiling was calculated based on **PSC costs**, despite **PFI-based estimates being used for VfM justification**.

**Sewer Infrastructure Projects ‚Äî 2025 Ceiling Allocation**

| **VfM**                   | ‚Äî            | 56,443       |

> *Source: VfM Analysis, Ministry of Environment*

While PFI was shown to be more efficient in the VfM analysis, **the PSC cost was used** for the official ceiling, effectively **overstating the budget request**.

MOEF explained this as a buffer against post-agreement cost changes. However, **Article 7-2** of the *PPP Act* allows for contingency ceilings (up to 20%) to manage such uncertainties, and these should be recorded separately and **submitted transparently to the National Assembly**.
> *MOE(Ministry of Environment) noted that it bases ceiling requests on PFI costs for **privately proposed BTLs**, underscoring inconsistent practices between ministries.

### (d) Issues in Post-Implementation Management of BTL Projects

#### (a) Issues with Government Payment Accounting

##### 1. Reallocation of Sewer BTL Rental Payments to a New Budget Account

In the 2025 budget proposal, the Ministry of Environment shifted the funding for BTL rental payments from the **Environment Improvement Special Account** to the **Balanced Regional Development Special Account (Regional Support Division)**, without clear justification despite annual costs exceeding KRW 300 billion.

| Year | Environment Account | Balanced Development Account |
|------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| 2024 | 349,358             | ‚Äì                            |
| 2025 | ‚Äì                   | 357,040                      |

> *Unit: KRW million ‚Äî Source: Ministry of Environment*

- The Environment Account is supported by legally defined revenue sources (e.g., environmental charges), while the Balanced Development Account lacks such independent revenue.
- This shift may bypass spending controls and **expand fiscal exposure** without corresponding safeguards.

##### 2. Violations of Statutory Subsidy Ratios

Some local BTL projects **breach legally mandated matching ratios** under the *Subsidy Management Act*.

**Example: 2009 Anseong BTL Project**

| Year | Rent (KRW M) | O&M (KRW M) | Matching Ratio (Gov:Local) |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| 2025 | 5,285        | 676         | 68.8:31.2                   |

However, local government reports show that **KRW 788M of local costs were covered by a central government water basin fund**, pushing the effective central subsidy to **84.9%**, which violates the legal limit.

| Source                | Budgeted | Disbursed | Rate (%) |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| National Subsidy (B) | 3,357    | 3,357     | 68.8     |
| Local Gov. (C)       | 1,525    | 1,525     | ‚Äì        |
|  ‚Äì Municipal Share   | 737      | 737       | ‚Äì        |
|  ‚Äì Basin Fund Share  | 788      | 788       | ‚Äì        |
| Effective Subsidy    | ‚Äì        | ‚Äì         | **84.9** |

##### 3. Improper Use of Rental Funds Due to Contract Extension

The Ministry of Defense extended the BTL operational period for the military broadband network without a new agreement. It **reallocated rental payments as O&M expenses**, deviating from the original BTL purpose.

| Year | Rent (KRW M) | Change Summary |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 2019 | 24,836       | Standard amortization |
| 2020 | 11,054       | 10‚Üí13 year term, per unit rent reduced |

Later, KRW 1.62B of unused rent in 2023 was **repurposed as operating expenses**, despite no formal provision allowing this.

#### (b) Issues with Ancillary Revenue Settlement

Under Article 14(4) of the *PPP Act*, private operators may perform minor ancillary businesses (e.g., shops, cafes) with approval, but there are **no clear rules for profit settlement**.

**Example 1: Military Housing BTL Projects (2024)**

| Facility       | Q1 (KRW 1K) | Q2 (KRW 1K) | Q3 (KRW 1K) | Profit Split |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Daebang        | 56,126      | 51,415      | 56,289      | 50% excess ‚Üí SPC |
| Dongbinggo     | 20,000      | 20,000      | 20,000      | No excess      |
| Jinhae         | 225,879     | 228,344     | 228,144     | No excess      |
| Yecheon        | 1,330       | 1,330       | 1,333       | Partial        |
| Cheongwon      | 3,000       | 3,000       | 3,000       | No excess      |

- Excess profits are shared 50:50, but only **over predefined thresholds** in the agreement‚Äînot based on actual reconciliation.

**Example 2: Changwon Science Center BTL**

The BTL contract stipulates **rent deductions based on projected profits**, not actual operating results. There is **no quarterly or annual reconciliation** with real figures.

> *Source: BTL Implementation Agreement, Article 59 (2007)*

---

### üìå Policy Recommendations

1. Statutory rules should define **how ancillary profits are reconciled**.
2. **All ancillary revenue** should reduce rent or revert to the national treasury.
3. Fiscal oversight of BTL projects must include:
   - Compliance with subsidy law,
   - Prohibition of ad hoc reallocation of funds,
   - Enforcement of contract terms.

### (e) Legislative Disclosure of PPP Expansion Measures

In October 2024, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MOEF) released the ‚ÄúPPP Promotion Plan‚Äù to stimulate private investment in public infrastructure. While the plan introduces several operator-friendly incentives, it raises important concerns about potential increases in direct and indirect fiscal burdens and shifts in user cost responsibilities. It is imperative that the National Assembly be provided with timely and accurate estimates of these impacts.

#### Key Policy Measures and Their Fiscal Implications

| Government Payment Impact                  | PPP Promotion Plan Measure                                                                 | Identified Concern                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Upgrading-type PPP project implementation | Allow major renovation/expansion of aging PPP-operated infrastructure with continued fee rights | Delays public-sector takeover ‚Üí Loss of future government revenue                 |
| Concession period extensions              | Extend private operation periods up to 100 years                                            | Prolongs private revenue collection and defers fiscal return to the government     |
| Cost inflation retro-adjustments          | Allow 50% of inflation between price estimation and project notice to increase project cost | May result in excess payments beyond National Assembly-approved ceilings          |

### 1. Upgrading-Type PPPs and Deferred Public Revenue

First introduced in the 2022 Basic PPP Plan, this model permits private investors to upgrade existing PPP-operated infrastructure. They recover the investment not only from the expanded section but from the entire facility's usage fees.

#### Revenue Flow Before and After Policy Shift

| Phase                | Operator Revenue                   | Government Revenue                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Normal Termination  | Usage fees during 20-year operation | Usage fees post-reversion to public   |
| Post-upgrade Period | Continued usage fees (incl. upgrades) | Deferred or eliminated public revenue |

This leads to reduced public-sector fiscal revenue despite savings on initial capital. Moreover, existing users may end up subsidizing upgraded facilities they do not use, raising questions of fairness and accountability.

---

### 2. Concession Period Extensions and Democratic Oversight

MOEF proposes allowing concession periods of up to **100 years**. While this may support long-term operation, it defers public-sector fiscal benefits indefinitely.

MOEF has cited a **2009 Supreme Court ruling** (2007Îëê13159) involving the Seoul‚ÄìChuncheon Expressway, where the Court upheld the legality of including subsidy commitments in PPP contracts without prior parliamentary approval. However, that case involved annualized subsidies‚Äînot permanent reassignments of future public revenue.

Thus, it remains unclear whether significant long-term shifts in fiscal inflows, like those arising from extended concessions, require **legislative scrutiny equivalent to budget law**.

---

### 3. Construction Cost Revisions in Ongoing BTL Projects

To alleviate financial strain on operators due to inflation, MOEF introduced a special provision under Article 168-5 of the 2024 PPP Basic Plan:

> For BTL projects publicly notified before December 31, 2022, and lacking inflation adjustments, 50% of the inflation from the price estimation date to the notice date may be reflected in total project cost.

#### Education Sector Application (October 2024)

On October 23, the Ministry of Education issued guidance to all regional education offices and national universities instructing them to **retroactively reflect 50% of price escalation** in construction costs, impacting final government payment obligations.

This adjustment increases fiscal outlays for previously approved projects, raising concerns about compliance with National Assembly-approved BTL ceilings.

---

### Policy Recommendations

To preserve democratic legitimacy and uphold fiscal transparency, the following steps are necessary:

1. **Estimate and report** all direct and indirect fiscal burdens arising from the 2024 PPP Promotion Plan.
2. **Assess and disclose** the likely impact on **user fees**, especially for upgraded infrastructure.
3. **Reaffirm National Assembly oversight** by ensuring that structural policy changes (e.g., inflation recognition, term extensions) are brought under legislative review when affecting long-term public revenue.
