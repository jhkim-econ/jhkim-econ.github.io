# 1. Introduction

## 1.A  Overview of Public Financing Programs

Public financing programs are policy-based financial tools that channel credit
and capital to targeted sectors. They include **loans**, **interest subsidies**,
**credit guarantees**, and **equity investments**.

The *Korea Institute of Finance (2013)* defines public financing as finance with
a public purpose that corrects market failures by improving access and
affordability of capital.  
The *National Assembly Budget Office (2022)* describes it as funding and
services provided by public financial institutions under the *Act on the
Management of Public Institutions*. Programs are broadly grouped into SME,
export, development, housing, and inclusive-finance categories.

Public financing can be classified by funding type:

1. **Loan support** –  
   *Direct loans* are provided and managed by public institutions that bear the
   credit risk. *Indirect loans* are executed through commercial banks, with
   repayment to the government as agreed.  
2. **Interest subsidies** – The government covers part of the interest-rate
   gap between policy and market lending.  
3. **Guarantee support** – Institutions such as KODIT and KIBO provide credit
   guarantees that activate upon borrower default.  
4. **Equity investment support** – The government invests equity through funds
   or special-purpose vehicles to mobilize private investment.

## 1.B  FY 2023 Budget Execution by Ministry

In 2023, the combined execution of public-financing budgets across 22 ministries
was ₩ 43.2 trillion, or 96.3 percent of the ₩ 44.9 trillion final appropriation.
Three ministries—Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT), SMEs and Startups
(MSS), and Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA)—accounted for about
82 percent of the total.

## 1.C  Expenditure Trends by Support Type, 2019–2023

Between 2019 and 2023, total public-financing outlays averaged around ₩ 45 trillion.
Interest-subsidy programs expanded the fastest—growing 20 percent per year and
reaching ₩ 1.73 trillion in 2023.  Equity-investment programs also increased,
while loans stayed broadly stable and guarantees fell as COVID-related support
phased out.

<div class="table-caption"><strong>Table 2.</strong> Public Financing by Support Type, 2019–2023  
<em>Unit: million KRW; average annual growth rate (%)</em></div>

| Support Type       | 2019        | 2020        | 2021        | 2022        | 2023        | Avg. Growth (%) |

# 2. Implementation Review and Findings

This section reviews how loan and interest-subsidy programs were implemented in
2023, focusing on fiscal performance, administrative design, and transparency.
It highlights cases of under-execution, over-execution, and emerging risks to
fiscal discipline.

---

## 2.A  Structure of Loan and Interest-Subsidy Programs

The *2023 Budget Compilation and Fund Management Guidelines* encouraged
ministries to convert direct government loans into interest-subsidy programs.
The intent was to lower fiscal outlays while keeping credit accessible.

> *“Convert direct lending programs into interest-subsidy-based ones, reducing
> total expenditure while expanding the number of beneficiaries.”*

From a **budget perspective**, direct loans require full disbursement of the
principal as expenditure in the year of payment.  Interest subsidies, by
contrast, fund only the rate difference, easing near-term fiscal pressure.
From a **policy perspective**, direct loans help borrowers with low credit or
collateral, while subsidies depend on banks’ willingness to lend and may narrow
access for riskier borrowers.

High market interest rates in 2023 also widened the policy-market rate gap,
increasing the fiscal cost of subsidies and making some programs less attractive
to participants.  Several new subsidy-type programs therefore recorded weak
performance.

---

### Low Execution after Conversion from Direct Loans

Some programs converted from loans to subsidies in 2022 showed almost no
execution in 2023 because of poor coordination and limited demand.  
The **Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE)** added interest-subsidy
lines in its *Energy and Resources Special Account* and *Electricity Industry Fund*,
yet none were implemented.

<div class="table-caption"><strong>Table 3.</strong> MOTIE Interest-Subsidy Programs, 2023  
<em>Unit: million KRW</em></div>

| Fund / Program | Sub-program | Funding Type | Lending Institution | 2023 Budget | Executed |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|
| Energy & Resources Fund | Energy-Saving Facility Installation | Interest Subsidy | Korea Energy Agency | 1,500 | 0 |
| Electricity Industry Fund | Renewable Energy Finance Support | Interest Subsidy | – | 3,130 | 0 |
| Electricity Industry Fund | Green Innovation Finance | Interest Subsidy | – | 188 | 0 |
| **Total** |  |  |  | **4,818** | **0** |

<small><strong>Notes:</strong> Programs created through the 2022 supplementary budget to replace
loan funding.

MOTIE attributed the zero-execution outcome to high interest rates and to banks’
preference for risk-free direct loans.  The case illustrates the need for
feasibility checks and coordination with financial institutions before
structural changes.

---

### Over-Execution and Fiscal Risks

Other ministries exceeded approved ceilings, creating unpaid obligations and
potential breaches of parliamentary budget authority.  Two examples are the
**Agricultural Loan Interest Subsidy Program** under MAFRA and the
**Forest Management Composite Fund** under the Korea Forest Service (KFS).

<div class="table-caption"><strong>Table 4.</strong> Agricultural Loan Interest Subsidy Program (MAFRA), 2023  
<em>Unit: million KRW</em></div>

| Category | Initial Budget | Post-Adjustment | Actual Payment | Obligation | Unpaid |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| MAFRA → NACF | 451,942 | 451,461 | 416,693 | 578,739 | –162,046 |

activities.  Unpaid = carry-over obligations to FY 2024 under the Special Account
for Agricultural and Rural Structure Improvement.  
<strong>Source:</strong> Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA).</small>

The unpaid balance of ₩ 162 billion (about 32 percent of the 2024 budget) shows
the quasi-mandatory nature of such subsidies and the fiscal strain that arises
when appropriations fall short.

<div class="table-caption"><strong>Table 5.</strong> Forest Fund Interest Subsidy Shortfall (KFS), 2023  
<em>Unit: million KRW</em></div>

| Category | Budget (A) | Actual Need (B) | Shortfall (A–B) |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| Existing Loans | 7,399 | 9,105 | –1,706 |
| New Loans | 247 | 1,909 | –1,662 |
| **Total** | **9,487** | **11,014** | **–1,527** |

<small><strong>Notes:</strong> KFS reported total subsidy needs exceeding the approved budget by
₩ 1.53 billion.  
<strong>Source:</strong> Korea Forest Service (2024).</small>

Repeated over-execution of quasi-obligatory interest subsidies weakens fiscal
discipline and can generate arrears.  Stronger monitoring and reconciliation
procedures are required.

---

### Oversight by Type of Interest-Subsidy Support

Government interest-subsidy programs differ by (i) how support is paid to financial institutions and (ii) how the borrower’s rate is set.

- **Payment to financial institutions**
  1) **Actual-cost reimbursement** – government reimburses the measured interest gap;  
  2) **Estimated lump-sum (advance)** – government pays a pre-agreed rate × average loan balance.

- **Setting the borrower rate**
  1) **Floating-subsidy model** – borrower rate is fixed (target), subsidy varies by case;  
  2) **Fixed-subsidy model** – subsidy rate is fixed, borrower rate varies.

<div class="table-caption"><strong>Table 6.</strong> Program Structure Matrix</div>

| Borrower Rate Model | Payment to Financial Institutions | Example Programs |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Floating subsidy (borrower rate fixed) | Actual-cost reimbursement | FSC: Low-Income Small Business Interest Subsidy |
| Floating subsidy (borrower rate fixed) | Lump-sum (estimated advance) | FSC: Hope Plus Interest Subsidy |
| Fixed subsidy (subsidy rate fixed) | Actual-cost reimbursement | MAFRA: Agricultural Loan Interest Subsidy; MOLIT: Housing Loan Interest Subsidy |
| Fixed subsidy (subsidy rate fixed) | Lump-sum (estimated advance) | - |

---

In reimbursement schemes with a **fixed borrower target rate** (e.g., 2.5 percent), the government pays the difference between each bank’s **actual lending rate** and the target. This weakens incentives for both parties to lower pre-subsidy rates: borrowers face the same final rate irrespective of shopping around, and banks may benefit from higher pre-subsidy quotes.

For FSC Interest-Subsidy Support (2023), ₩56.82 billion out of ₩63.02 billion was executed (90.2 percent). The program consisted of two subcomponents: the Low-Income Small Business Interest Subsidy (budget ₩27.03 billion; execution ₩21.88 billion) and the Hope Plus Interest Subsidy (budget ₩35.99 billion; execution ₩35.01 billion). Within these, only the Low-Income Small Business Interest Subsidy operated on a reimbursement basis tied to fixed target lending rates.

Accordingly, when interest-subsidy programs are operated by linking the subsidy rate to the target lending rate on a loan-by-loan basis, it is essential to enforce strict oversight to prevent moral hazard by individual financial institutions. In addition, close scrutiny is required to assess the appropriateness of subsidy claims from institutions whose average calculated lending rates are higher than those of their peers.

---

In lump-sum interest-subsidy programs, the subsidy is calculated as a pre-agreed rate (e.g., 2.1 percent) applied to the average outstanding loan balance. This structure requires ex-post settlement to reconcile differences between the assumed and actual lending rates and balances.

For the FSC Hope Plus Interest Subsidy (2023), the budget was based on an assumed average lending rate of 6.3 percent, a target rate of 3.3 percent, and a 70 percent coverage ratio, yielding a subsidy rate of 2.1 percent. The assumed average lending rate used for budgeting increased from 4.5 percent in 2022 to 6.3 percent in 2023.

Following this scheme, KODIT disbursed lump-sum subsidies to 14 banks:

As of July 2024, there had been no ex-post reconciliation against realized 2023 lending rates. Because the weighted-average rate in the low-income program was 5.61 percent, it is likely that the Hope Plus program, which serves higher-credit borrowers, recorded an average rate lower than the assumed 6.3 percent. In the absence of proper settlement, fiscal costs may therefore be overstated.

Accordingly, annual reconciliation should be required for lump-sum programs. This includes updating realized average lending rates and balances, clawing back any overpayments, and publicly disclosing settlement results.

### 2.B. Strengthening Management and Operational Frameworks

Program management is split between (i) **indirect cost inclusion** (administrative costs absorbed in the operating budgets of affiliated agencies) and (ii) **direct budget allocation** (explicit management lines). Audits identified two weaknesses: some agencies **retain a share of loan repayments** as fees (off-budget), and some **deduct administrative costs from interest-subsidy envelopes** (non-transparent).

<div class="table-caption"><strong>Table 10.</strong> Examples of Explicit Management Allocations (2023)</div>

| Ministry | Fund/Account | Program (Sub-program) | Description | Budget Item | Budget (₩ mn) | Executed (₩ mn) |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|
| MOLIT | Urban Housing Fund | Management Fee | HUG fee for fund/loan management | General Supplies | 3,511 | 2,740 |
| MOU | Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund | Management Fee | Outsourced fund-ops cost | General Services | 2,182 | 2,182 |
| MSS | Startup & SME Promotion Fund | Interest-subsidy Ops | System build and reconciliation | Services & Assets | 1,000 | 992 |

### 2.B.1  Off-Budget Retention of Loan Repayments

Several programs allow implementing agencies to directly **retain portions of principal/interest** as handling fees—an exception to gross-budgeting.

<div class="table-caption"><strong>Table 11.</strong> Cases of Direct Use of Loan Repayments as Fees (2023)</div>

| Ministry | Program (Sub-program) | 2023 Budget (₩ mn) | Fee Type | Fee Formula | Actual Fee (₩ mn) | Implementer |
|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--|--:|:--|
| MOE | Future Environmental Industry Development Loan | 278,893 | Loan handling | Σ(Daily balance × 0.1%) | 597 | KEITI |
| MOTIE | Carbon-Neutral Transition Loan (Flagship) | 98,115 | Loan handling | 0.1% of balance | 90 | KICOX |
| MOTIE | Special Overseas Resource Dev. Loan (Oil/Gas) | 172,716 | Loan handling | 1.0% of balance | 1,214 | Korea Energy Agency |
| MOTIE | Special Overseas Resource Dev. Loan (Minerals) | 2,624 | Loan handling | 1.0% of balance | 281 | Korea Energy Agency |

<small><strong>Source:</strong> Ministry submissions (2024).</small>

**Policy implication.** Replace off-budget retention with **appropriated management lines**; publish fee formulae and rates; and reconcile annually.

### 2.B.2  Deducting Administration from Interest-Subsidy Envelopes

Some programs draw administrative costs directly from subsidy funds, which are **not** subject to detailed ex-post reconciliation.

<div class="table-caption"><strong>Table 12.</strong> Cases of Administrative Costs Charged to Subsidy Envelopes (2023)</div>

| Ministry | Program | Total Budget (₩ mn) | Fee Type | Basis | Actual Fee (₩ mn) | Funding Source |
|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--|--:|:--|
| MOTIE | EV Promotion (Interest Support) | 2,490 | Planning/Evaluation | 3.5% of project cost | 88 | Deducted from subsidy |
| MOE | Future Environmental Industry Development Loan (Interest Support) | 8,893 | Loan handling | Σ(Daily balance × 0.1%) | 373 | Deducted from subsidy |
| MOE | Clean Air Transition Facility Loan | 2,400 | Loan handling | Σ(Daily balance × 0.1%) | 9 | Deducted from subsidy |

<strong>Source:</strong> Ministry data (2024).</small>

**Policy implication.** Prohibit charging administration costs to item 320-05 (interest-subsidy) and fund these costs through explicit budget lines with settlement requirements.  

### 2.B.3  Delegation and Re-outsourcing without Clear Legal Basis (MSIT/IITP)

Under the **ICT Convergence Technology Development Loan Support**, IITP subcontracted fund management to **IBK** and allowed IBK to deduct a **0.10%** fee directly from repayments, while commercial banks deducted additional handling (**0.6%**) and guarantee (**0.9%**) fees before remitting.

Program statutes (Framework Act and Enforcement Decree) permit delegation to sector agencies (e.g., Korea Communications Agency) and operation “through financial institutions,” but **do not** explicitly authorize **re-outsourcing of fund management** to commercial banks or direct deduction of fees from loan proceeds.

**Policy implication.** Avoid allowing commercial banks to use loan principal and interest payments to cover management or administrative fees that effectively function as private-delegation service charges, especially in the absence of a legal basis for re-delegation.

### 2.B.4  Fee-Rate Governance and Cross-Agency Comparison

Loan handling fees vary across ministries and programs; many anchor at **1.0%**, but several use higher rates (e.g., **1.5%**). A central benchmark and periodic review are warranted.

<div class="table-caption"><strong>Table 13.</strong> Illustrative Handling-Fee Rates by Ministry (2023)</div>

| Ministry | Program (selected) | Fee Rate (%) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| MSS | Small Business Support Loans | 1.0 |
| MOEL | Living Stability, Wage Arrears, Safety Facilities | 0.6–1.2 (mostly 1.0) |
| MSIT | ICT Tech Dev. Support Loans (excl. guarantee fee) | 0.6–0.7 |
| MOEF | Self-Reliance Loans for Persons with Disabilities | 1.5 |
| MAFRA | Multiple agricultural loan programs | 0.0–1.25 |
| MCST | Tourism, Sports Industry Finance | 1.0 |
| MOTIE | Urban Gas Facility; Renewable Energy; Green Innovation | ~1.5 |
| MOF | Tanker Modernization; Fisheries programs | 1.25; 1.37 |
| MOE | Environmental Industry Development; Clean Air Facility | 1.0; 0.1–0.9 |

<small><strong>Source:</strong> Ministry submissions (2024).</small>

**Case examples.**  
- **MOEF Self-Reliance Loans for Persons with Disabilities (2023):** fee **1.5%**   
- **MOTIE loan programs:** several operate near **1.5%** handling fees (Urban Gas Facility, Renewable Energy, Green Innovation).

**Policy implication.** Establish unified, cross-ministerial standards for loan-handling fee rates, and align ministry-specific regulations with a common framework.

### 2.B.5  Settlement of Unused Subsidy Balances and Interest Income (MOTIE/KIAT)

In 2023, MOTIE disbursed **₩2.49 bn** in interest-subsidy funds to **KIAT** for EV supply-chain support. Only **₩853 mn** was executed for new cases; **₩1,549 mn** remained with KIAT **without formal carryover approval**. Interest income accrued on idle balances (**₩15.61 mn in 2022; ₩68.25 mn in 2023**) had **not** been remitted to the treasury by end-June 2024.
