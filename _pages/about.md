I am a Research Analyst at the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, specializing in economic policy analysis and budget program evaluation. Over the past decade, I have worked at the intersection of legislative research and applied economics, contributing to evidence-based fiscal policymaking.

I earned my B.A. in Economics and Business Administration from Seoul National University in 2016, graduating first in my class as valedictorian of the cohort. Seeking a deeper understanding of how economic and fiscal policies are shaped within government institutions, I sat for and passed the National Legislative Civil Service Examination—one of South Korea’s most competitive public service entry routes—which led to my appointment at  [National Assembly Budget Office (NABO)](https://korea.nabo.go.kr/naboEng/main/main.do), Korea’s premier nonpartisan fiscal institution. There, I began collaborating directly with PhD-trained economists from the outset of my career.

My experience at the intersection of legislative research and applied economic analysis has shaped my commitment to pursuing more rigorous research in economics. In 2025, I am advancing this pursuit through ongoing working papers, two of which are introduced in the [Research Section →]](https://jhkim-econ.github.io/research/).
