## Hello! I'm Junghwan Kim  

I am a Legislative Research Officer at the National Assembly of South Korea with over a decade of experience in economic policy analysis and budget program evaluation. 

While earning a B.A. in Economics and Business Administration from Seoul National University, I sought a deeper understanding of how economic and fiscal policies are shaped within government institutions. Motivated by this interest, I successfully passed the National Legislative Civil Service Examination, one of South Korea’s most competitive public service entry routes. This achievement granted me entry into the [National Assembly Budget Office (NABO)](https://korea.nabo.go.kr/naboEng/main/main.do), Korea’s premier nonpartisan institution for fiscal policy research, where I began collaborating directly with PhD-level economists at the outset of my career.

At NABO, I led economic evaluations of large-scale government programs and analyzed structural challenges in the economy. As a senior analyst for the Special Committee on Budget and Accounts, I authored a range of independent reports addressing critical issues such as moral hazard in policy implementation, budget oversight, and long-term fiscal sustainability. My experience at the intersection of legislative research and applied economic analysis has shaped my commitment to evidence-based policymaking.

In 2025, I remain committed to advancing independent economic inquiry beyond institutional boundaries, as reflected in the working papers currently underway.
