## Hello! I'm Junghwan Kim  

I’m a legislative research officer at the National Assembly of South Korea with a decade of experience in economic analysis and policy evaluation.  

After completing a B.A. in Economics and Business Administration at Seoul National University, I served as an economic analyst at the [National Assembly Budget Office (NABO)](https://korea.nabo.go.kr/naboEng/main/main.do), Korea’s leading nonpartisan institution for fiscal policy research and economic analysis. 

At NABO, I led evaluations of budget programs and conducted economic analyses of structural challenges in collaboration with PhD-level economists. As a senior analyst for the Special Committee on Budget and Accounts, I authored independent reports on public finance, with a focus on budget oversight and moral hazard in policy implementation.

In 2025, my foremost motivation in 2025 is to advance independent economic inquiry beyond institutional boundaries, as reflected in the working papers currently in progress.
