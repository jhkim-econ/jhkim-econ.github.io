I am a Research Analyst at the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, specializing in economic policy analysis and budget program evaluation. Over the past decade, I have worked at the intersection of legislative research and applied economics, contributing to evidence-based fiscal policymaking.

My experience bridging empirical analysis and legislative decision-making has shaped my commitment to pursuing more rigorous research in economics. In 2025, I am advancing this pursuit through ongoing working papers, two of which are introduced in the [Research Section](https://jhkim-econ.github.io/research/).


### Research Interests
- Labor economics with emphasis on structural shifts in industries and sustainability    
- Public finance on focusing on the interplay between government interventions and private mechanisms
